#### Linear Data Structures
- **Array**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
- **Linked List**: A sequential collection of elements, where each element points to the next.
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stack**: A collection of elements with Last In First Out (LIFO) access.
- **Queue**: A collection of elements with First In First Out (FIFO) access.
  - Circular Queue
  - Priority Queue
  - Deque (Double Ended Queue)

#### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure with a root value and subtrees of children.
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree (Balanced Binary Search Tree)
  - Red-Black Tree
  - Segment Tree
  - Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges.
  - Directed Graph
  - Undirected Graph
  - Weighted Graph
  - Unweighted Graph

#### Hash-Based Structures
- **HashTable/HashMap**: A structure that maps keys to values, designed for efficient retrieval.
- **HashSet**: A collection that contains no duplicate elements.

#### Others
- **Heap**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property (min-heap or max-heap).
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.
