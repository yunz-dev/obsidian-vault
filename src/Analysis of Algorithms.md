Algorithm analysis is the process of determining the [[Time Complexity | time]] and [[Space Complexity | space complexity]] of an [[Algorithms | algorithm]]
- measures the [[Running Time | running time]] and [[Memory | memory]] requirements as input size increases
- helps understand the efficiency and scalability of an algorithm
