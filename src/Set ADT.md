A set is an example of an abstract data type: there is a collection of operations that can be performed on them but the exact details of the implementation are unimportant, as long as they produce the desired behavior from the user's perspective.
- an ordered array allows for binary search to be used, but requires the elements to be shifted to maintain order when inserting
- A linked list does not require shifting but requires a linear traversal when inserting and searching for elements

[[Binary Search Trees | BST]] is a solution to both these problems, the way searching works in a BST is similar to how binary search works[]().
